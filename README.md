# lab-reporter
### Udacity AWS Nanodegree final project

## Functionality
This App aims to provide an alternative to hand-written laboratory logs. It will have the following main components:

### Log Entries
Users can create, edit and delete log entries. Only the author of an entry may edit or delete the entry. Log entries are identified by their date and optionally an additional title. Entries need to be tagged with one project in order to enable users to view only entries that are relevant to the project they are assigned to. A log entry can have multiple images attached to it.

### Projects
Users can create projects to group entries by and share antries across the project team. Projects hold a description and a list of project team members. Projects are linked to entries by tagging an entry with a project tag. Every project team member can view all entries that are tagged with that project.
